> Before you start working on your lab, we have prepared an environment for you already!   
> Go to this [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@Loai17/API-Labs-Setup), clone it to your account/copy it to your local machine, and feel free to start working!  
  
  
#### Resources:  
- [COVID19 API (RapiAPI)](https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data?endpoint=apiendpoint_80bfb292-72a4-485b-8e76-2900bd8246bd) - Go to RapidAPI website, find the documentation you need about this specific API and obtain the information needed to complete the lab.
  
## Instructions:

In this lab, we will be using one of many COVID19 APIs, it allows us to get relevant information about the COVID19 statistics on specific dates, in specific countries!  

1. Add a form to your `home.html`, it should have 2 types of inputs:
    1. A dropdown list of country names - Here's a [resource](https://gist.github.com/danrovito/977bcb97c9c2dfd3398a#file-countrydropdown-html) to help you out get this set up.
    2. A date format input. (Should take Day, Month, and Year)

2. Create a new route and link the button to it, OR, use an already existent one and link it also.
    - In the route, the function should return the `confirmed` and `recovered` cases numbers of this specific country on that specific date.
    - You should pass that information to `home.html`, and display it there!
