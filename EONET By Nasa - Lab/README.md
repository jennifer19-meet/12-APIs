> Before you start working on your lab, we have prepared an environment for you already!   
> Go to this [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@Loai17/API-Labs-Setup), clone it to your account/copy it to your local machine, and feel free to start working!  
  
  
#### Resources:  
- [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/) - Go to Nasa's open data API portal, find the documentation you need (*"EONET"*), and obtain the information needed.

## What is EONET?
> The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) is a prototype web service with the goal of:  
  
> 1. Providing a curated source of continuously updated natural event data.  
> 2. Providing a service that links those natural events to thematically-related web service-enabled image sources.

### What are natural events according to NASA?
> Natural events are events that happen naturally (duh), such as:

> Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Floods, Fires, Severe Storms, Temparature extremes, and many more... 

  
## Instructions:
In this lab, we will be using the EONET API by NASA, it allows us to get relevant information about the **"Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker"**.  
</br>
1. Add a button to your `home.html`, the button should say "Get Event!".
    - We're going to use this button to update our HTML page with an event information accessible by the EONET API!

2. Create a new route and link the button to it, OR, use an already existent one and link it also.
    - In the route, the function should return the 1st **event title**, and **sources links** (if any).
    - You should pass that information to `home.html`, and display it there!
    
3. Change the function so it displays **ALL** event titles and sources in `home.html`!
