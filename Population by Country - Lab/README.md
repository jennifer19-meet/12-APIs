> Before you start working on your lab, we have prepared an environment for you already!   
> Go to this [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@Loai17/API-Labs-Setup), clone it to your account/copy it to your local machine, and feel free to start working!  
  
  
#### Resources:  
- [Country Population API (RapiAPI)](https://rapidapi.com/aldair.sr99/api/world-population?endpoint=apiendpoint_4edc9a8e-1609-4dcc-9c83-aefe45b51a5f) - Go to RapidAPI website, find the documentation you need about this specific API and obtain the information needed to complete the lab.  
  
## Instructions:

In this lab, we will be using the Country Population API to be able to show each country's population on our dynamic website!

1. Add a form to your `home.html`, It should contain a *dropdown* input, which is basically a list of country names!
    - Here's a [resource](https://gist.github.com/danrovito/977bcb97c9c2dfd3398a#file-countrydropdown-html) to help you out get this set up.
    - We're going to use this form to choose a country, and when clicking on 'submit', the page should show population number! 

2. Create a new route and link the button to it, OR, use an already existent one and link it also.
    - In the route, the function should return the **chosen country's** population number.
    - You should pass that information to `home.html`, and display it there!

3. Add another route and HTML page, call it `all_country_populations`. When visiting this route, it should display a list of all countries and population numbers!
