> Before you start working on your lab, we have prepared an environment for you already!   
> Go to this [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@Loai17/API-Labs-Setup), clone it to your account/copy it to your local machine, and feel free to start working!  
  
  
#### Resources:  
- [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/) - Go to Nasa's open data API portal, find the documentation you need (*"Mars Rover Photos"*), and obtain the information needed.  
  
## Instructions:

In this lab, we will be using the Mars Rover API by NASA, it allows us to get real picture taken by the Mars Rover!  

1. Add a button to your `home.html`, the button should say "Get Image!".
    - We're going to use this button to update our HTML page with an image from the Mars Rover!

2. Create a new route and link the button to it, OR, use an already existent one and link it also.
    - In the route, the function should return the 1st image taken by the Mars Rover.
    - You should pass that image to `home.html`, and display it!
    
3. Change the function so it displays random images taken by the Mars Rover everytime you click on the "Get Image!" button.
